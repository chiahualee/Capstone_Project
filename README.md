  2. 9/27 Meeting Results with Michael:

After the meeting today, me, Sheena and Wei have been thinking about the next steps. Apparently, the third bucket, which is about using machine learning to give actionable prompt to users, is exactly what our client is after. There are two major ideas on the table now --- One is about modelling  the bg pattern on individual user basis. With this pattern, we need to generate some useful health-relevant prompts (EX: you had better eat something now, your BG tends to be low on Sunday Evening ) that would engage our customers to be willing to take BG tests more often. The other is about suggesting what action to take now based on user’s exercise plan and we would have to comp up with an algorithm to better predict the drop or rise on BG value  given a certain kind/amount of exercise. Wei will be focusing more on the first idea and I will try to dig into the second one. Amit and Sheena will be picking from either one you prefer and work more closely on that for a complete proposal for the client.

Also, based on what Michael said today, we need a closer look into our competitors’ apps or some apps from other fields and try to see if we can borrow some ideas and features that we find interesting. Maybe Sheena and Amit can look into that and give us some feed back on our next meeting.


Work on Sunday:
1. Preprocessing Data
2. Competitor Analysis
